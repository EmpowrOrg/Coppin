Coppin is an assignment creator and grader meant to be used with [Doctor](https://github.com/EmpowrOrg/Doctor)
and [CodeEditorXblock](https://github.com/EmpowrOrg/CodeEditorXblock). By pairing these three tools, any organization that utilizes
Open Edx will have the ability to teach and grade coding assignments.

Empowr's goal is to create an equitable future for all, and therefore we believe in open-source technologies.

## Technology

We use Ktor as it's a fast and easy to learn framework for server creation. Exposed is used to make working with the
database easier and offer a layer of protection.

## How you can support

The number one way to support this project is by donating to [Empowr](https://empowrco.org). If you are technically
inclined and would like to submit code, then feel free to contribute to any area on the following list.

- Front-End Development. There are some needed User Experience improvements. Some ideas are:
  - Find better location of delete buttons
  - Ensure consistent input styling on text and number inputs.
  - Fix styling on checkboxes
  - Create common error pages (404, 401, etc)
  - Add authentication pages (Login, Create Account)
- Back-End Development.
  - We wish to add more integrity checks to data when it's saved
  - Adding authentication
- Bugs & Features. We are open to adding new features. So if you have a cool idea, create it!
